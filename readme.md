# Part 2: Azure portal

| Azure Resource type      | Name (example)        | Comments                                                                                                                  |
|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Resource group     | OpenAIBot1-PRD-EUN-rg |  Set the region nearest to you for all resources, except those from OpenAI        |
| Storage account    | openaibot1sa001dsfwd   | storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and may contain numbers and lowercase letters only. Your storage account name must be unique within Azure                                                                                                                          |
|                    |                        |Go to Storage Account created, Security & Network -> Access Keys -> Show and Copy Connection string. Put it in the local.settings.json
| SA blob container  | history                |                  |
| Function           | OpenAIBot1-932u4fh     | Settings - Python, 3.11, NEU , Serverless = eventrdiven.  |
|                    |                        | Open the Function created, Overview, Functions (on the right), click on its Name (http_trigger by default), click "Get Function Url" on the top, copy that and paste to notepad
| Azure OpenAI       | Openaibot-prd-cae-openai | Check email from csgate@microsoft.com for the Region (We are pleased to inform you that you have been onboarded to Azure OpenAI Service GPT-4 in the CanadaEast region.) <br> Go to Keys and Deployments and copy Key1 and Endpoint to your local.settings.json |
| Open AI Model      | gpt-4     | Go to Azure OpenAI you created, Model Deployments and click Manage Deployments. Click Create new deployment. <br> Model - gpt-4 1106-Preview, Standard, name gpt-4 (hardcoded in the app) |

# Part 3: Telegram

1. Find the contact `Botfather` with the blue checkmark
2. Type `/newbot`. Type a **name** for the bot. Can be changed in the future. 
3. Type a **username** for the bot. It should end with the `'bot'` word and cannot be changed in the future.
4. Copy HTTP API access token and paste the it to your `local.settings.json` file and to a notepad temporary

5. Now its time to set a WebHook to point to our Azure Function. We will use Telegram Bot Api for that. <br>
The first command we need is: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/setWebhook?url={function_url}` <br>
where `<token>` is your telegram API token from step 3.4, and `{function_url}` is your Function URL copied in Azure setup part. <br> Let's take `https://func1-tg-partybot-3111hb.azurewebsites.net/api/http_trigger?` as an example for URL and `6255927130:AAFn8efklsgvy35TYk5MqWwFULknbanF3Js` as a token and construct our example request: <br>

`https://api.telegram.org/bot6255927130:AAFn8efklsgvy35TYk5MqWwFULknbanF3Js/setWebhook?url=https://func1-tg-partybot-3111hb.azurewebsites.net/api/http_trigger?` <br><br>
6. Now, copy, paste and run this request in your browser. If constucted correctly, you should see  `"description": "Webhook was set"`
7. You can check the webhook setting by calling another request: <br>
`https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/getWebhookInfo`

# Part 4: VS Code

This is the last part of the workshop. Now we need to deploy out application to a Function and set variables for it

1. Make sure you have set correctly all settings in your `local.settings.json`.
2. Go to 'View', then 'Command Palette', and type `Azure Function: Deploy to Azure Function App`. Choose your Subscription, then choose you Function created in the 2nd part. Click `Deploy`. This will overwrite previous application version, if any.
